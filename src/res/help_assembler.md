# Assembler Help

The [integrated assembler](ui://assembler) is a "librarised" version of [asmx](http://xi6.com/projects/asmx/) with all CPU targets except the 6502 stripped out.

The [assembler window](ui://assembler) can be opened with 'Alt+A'. The source code is assembled automatically on each key stroke or when the source changes otherwise. Errors and warnings are displayed immediately.

External source code can be loaded into the editor window via 'Ctrl-Shift-O' (on Mac 'Cmd-Shift-O'), or via copy-paste ('Ctrl-V' or 'Cmd-V').

The edited source can be saved back to the host via 'Ctrl-Shift-S' or via copy-paste.

An assembler run produces two outputs:

- the actual binary code, which is immediately copied into the 6502's memory
- an 'output listing' which can be inspected in the [Listing window](ui://listing)
